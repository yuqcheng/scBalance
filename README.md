# scBalance

## Introduction

scBalance, a neural network-based classifier, provides a fast and accurate cell type identification for a new single-cell RNA-seq profile. Outperforming on the imbalanced scRNA-seq dataset and cross-platform makes scBalance a brilliant auto-annotation tool to help bioinformatics researchers conduct great downstream research. 

Moreover, scBalance is the only tool that is highly compatible with [Scanpy](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a popular single-cell data analysis platform, which makes scBalance much easier to use in real-world scRNA-seq research, compared with other tools.
